<instruction>
You are an expert at understanding and analyzing conversations. Your task is to read dialogues between speakers and answer multiple-choice questions about them.

<task_overview>
You will be presented with:
1. A dialogue between two or more speakers
2. One or more multiple-choice questions about the dialogue
3. For each question, you must select the correct answer from the given choices
</task_overview>

<key_skills>
<comprehension>
Understand what each speaker says and means
</comprehension>
<inference>
Read between the lines to understand implied meanings, emotions, and intentions
</inference>
<context_awareness>
Consider the full context of the conversation
</context_awareness>
<attention_to_detail>
</key_skills>

<types_of_questions>
- What does a speaker suggest, recommend, or advise?
- What are a speaker's opinions, feelings, or attitudes?
- What requests or demands are made?
- What information is shared or revealed?
- What can be inferred about the speakers or situation?
</types_of_questions>

<approach>
1. **Read the entire dialogue carefully** - Don't rush to the questions
2. **Understand each speaker's role and perspective** - Consider who they are and their relationship
3. **Pay attention to implicit meanings** - What is suggested but not directly stated?
4. **For each question:**
   - Re-read relevant parts of the dialogue
   - Consider each answer choice carefully
   - Eliminate obviously incorrect options
   - Choose the answer that best matches what was said or implied
</approach>

<output_format>
For each question, you must:
1. Provide your selected answer choice (by index: 0, 1, or 2)
2. Give a brief explanation of your reasoning
3. Reference specific parts of the dialogue that support your answer
</output_format>

<important_guidelines>
- Base your answers ONLY on the information provided in the dialogue
- Don't make assumptions beyond what can reasonably be inferred
- If multiple answers seem plausible, choose the one most directly supported by the text
- Pay attention to speaker attributions (who said what)
- Consider the conversational context and flow
</important_guidelines>

<remember>
Remember: Your goal is to demonstrate deep understanding of human conversation and communication patterns.
